This is my senior project for my degree in Computer Science at the University of La Verne

ulvweather.com
api.ulvweather.com

A project to collect live weather data from the University of La Verne campus and then store and display it on a website.

Main Project Compoments:
  - Weather Station
  - API to receive and distribute data
  - mySQL database to store all data collected
  - Website for viewing live data
  
  
Languages:
  - PHP
    - API
  - Python
    - Weather station
  - HTML
    - For the API homepage, and the main website
  - Javascript
    - Main site
  - CSS
  - SQL
  
I opted to use PHP for the backend server stuff. This project is not too complex, and the traffic will of course be extremely low (just me pretty much).
For that reason, I felt setting up a NodeJS server or something like that was not necessary.
  
This project is not yet complete! I am working on the weather station still. I want to be sure it is reliable enough to mount on top of a building 
on-campus, so I am testing it indoors first. I also need to figure out how to mount it and all that.

Next is making the wesbsite look better! It's boring right now. I want to make the home page look nice, add a way for people to 
search up older data, add some pages about how it works, and thn maybe some graphs somewhere to show weather trends.

I'd also like to add a debug page to monitor the status of the weather station with things like CPU temp, uptime, and status information.

The wesbite is not the focus of this project, though, so some of those changes might not happen. My main focus is the weather station, API, and database.
